"""
Tests for check commands.

These assert the specific verdicts gpio reaches on fixtures with pinned,
known properties, not just exit codes:

- ``places_test.parquet``: 766 rows, 1 row group, SNAPPY-compressed geometry,
  GeoParquet 1.0.0, has a ``bbox`` column (but no covering — 1.0 cannot carry
  one).
- ``buildings_test.parquet``: 42 rows, 1 row group, ZSTD-compressed geometry,
  GeoParquet 1.0.0, no bbox column.
- ``tests/data/canonical/places.parquet`` (``places_with_covering_file``):
  GeoParquet 1.1.0 with a proper bbox covering — the known-good contrast.

If a fixture is regenerated with different properties, update these constants
alongside it (see tests/data/canonical/README.md).
