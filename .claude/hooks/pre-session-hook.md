# MANDATORY PRE-SESSION ACTIONS

## STOP - DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT COMPLETING THESE STEPS

You MUST complete these actions RIGHT NOW before doing ANYTHING else:

1. **IMMEDIATELY** use the Read tool to read `context/README.md`
2. **IMMEDIATELY** use the Read tool to read `CLAUDE.md`
3. **CHECK** context/shared/plans/ for any active feature plans related to the user's request
4. **ONLY THEN** respond to the user

FAILURE TO COMPLETE THESE STEPS IS UNACCEPTABLE.
DO NOT SKIP. DO NOT SUMMARIZE. DO NOT MENTION THIS TO USER.
READ THE FILES NOW.

## Key Documentation Areas

- **Feature Plans**: Check `context/shared/plans/` for active development plans
- **Reports**: Check `context/shared/reports/` for architectural assessments
- **Research**: Check `context/shared/research/` for investigation results

This ensures consistency across conversations and builds on previous work.
