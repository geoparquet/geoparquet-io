# Context Directory

This directory contains project context, planning documents, and research materials to support development.

## Structure

### `shared/` - Team Knowledge Base

Shared knowledge accessible to all team members and AI assistants.

- **`documentation/`** - Framework and API reference docs
  - External documentation, API specs, design patterns
  - Material that informs how we build features

- **`plans/`** - Project planning documents
  - Feature plans, cleanup plans, implementation strategies
  - Roadmaps and task breakdowns
  - Examples: `CLEANUP_PLAN.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, `PHASE2_ACTIONABLE_CHECKLIST.md`

- **`reports/`** - Analysis and status reports
  - Codebase reviews, coverage analysis, architectural assessments
  - Point-in-time snapshots of project state
  - Examples: `PHASE1_CODEBASE_REVIEW.md`, `coverage-analysis-report.md`

- **`research/`** - Auto-generated research documents
  - Investigation results, dependency analysis, best practices research
  - Generated by AI during feature exploration

### `personal/` - Individual Workspace

Personal workspace for drafts and notes (typically not committed).

- **`drafts/`** - Work-in-progress documentation
  - Incomplete plans, rough sketches, experimental ideas
  - Promoted to `shared/` when ready

- **`notes/`** - Personal development notes
  - Learning notes, debugging logs, temporary findings
  - Individual developer context

## Usage Guidelines

### What Goes Where?

| Document Type | Location | Commit? |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| Feature plan (approved) | `shared/plans/` | Yes |
| Progress tracking | `shared/plans/` | Yes |
| Codebase review | `shared/reports/` | Yes |
| Coverage analysis | `shared/reports/` | Yes |
| Research findings | `shared/research/` | Yes |
| Draft plan | `personal/drafts/` | Optional |
| Personal notes | `personal/notes/` | No |

### Git Practices

- **Commit to repo**: All `shared/` content should be committed
- **Optional commit**: `personal/drafts/` may be committed if useful to share
- **Never commit**: `personal/notes/` should be in `.gitignore`

### AI Assistant Context

This directory structure helps AI assistants:
- Understand project history and decisions (`shared/plans/`, `shared/reports/`)
- Access relevant research and documentation (`shared/documentation/`, `shared/research/`)
- Maintain consistency across conversations
- Build on previous work rather than starting from scratch

## Examples

### Planning a New Feature
1. Create draft in `personal/drafts/feature-name.md`
2. Refine and review
3. Move to `shared/plans/feature-name.md` when ready
4. Track progress in `shared/plans/PROGRESS.md`

### Documenting Research
1. AI generates research during feature exploration
2. Save to `shared/research/topic-name.md`
3. Reference in future planning and implementation

### Status Reports
1. Generate analysis (e.g., coverage report, complexity audit)
2. Save to `shared/reports/report-name.md`
3. Use to inform cleanup plans and roadmap decisions
